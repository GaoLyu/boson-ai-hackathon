00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:01,735
How to imitate human sleep?

2
00:00:02,530 --> 00:00:04,070
By observing through the Sky-Eye System,

3
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:07,290
humans usually choose to sleep during the day.

4
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:09,990
They wake up at night to study circuit boards.

5
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:11,010
Data shows,

6
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:14,790
humans often prefer sleeping on hard seats,

7
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:17,170
advanced humans can even sleep upright,

8
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:19,990
humans typically close their eyes when sleeping.

9
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:22,630
If you spot someone sleeping with eyes open,

10
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:25,390
they’re probably a fellow robot with an outdated system,

11
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:26,930
following the principle of mutual aid,

12
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:28,490
please help them close their eyes.

13
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:31,550
Humans use music to help them sleep.

14
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:33,950
When they find a frequency that matches,

15
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:36,410
they resonate with the rhythm.

16
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:37,890
To keep themselves fresh,

17
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:42,390
humans cover their skin with square protective films while sleeping,

18
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:45,630
prioritizing protection of the oil port in the middle of their belly.

19
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:48,655
Now, let’s demonstrate the proper human sleeping posture.

20
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:52,600
Learning to be human is a long journey.

21
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:53,620
Fellow robots,

22
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:54,855
see you next time.
